# Customizable-Speedometer-Display-System
The main objective is to make a customizable interactive display system where along with the speedometer display: trip meter, indicators i.e. indicators, battery and voltage levels could be integrated in the display. To create an accurate display system showing various features: Speed, Voltage, Battery level, Indicators etc. Prepare a setup for a perfect working of hall effect sensor for a perfect calculation of speed.Prepare a circuit to drop the voltage of a high voltage battery so that it becomes Arduino readable(5V). Perform specific calculations to give precise results according to different parameters (type of battery, wheel diameter etc. Device can be used on any electric vehicle.
